In this post I'll talk about how to configure shared libraries so that
 they can be easily tested using with their own Jenkinsfile, and the
 traditional GitHub pull-request process.
I won't be talking about using
 https://github.com/jenkinsci/JenkinsPipelineUnit[JenkinsPipelineUnit]
 since I'm not hugely familiar with that yet.
Maybe I'll write another post about that
 https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cio.jenkins.archetypes%7Cglobal-shared-library%7C1.4%7Cmaven-archetype[now
 that it's included in a new maven archetype for shared libraries]!

First a little bit about Jenkins Pipeline shared libraries.
These are collections of reusable classes, and DSL scripts which act
 similar to steps provided by plugins.
Unlike steps from plugins, they won't show up in the 'Pipeline Syntax'
 page which is a really helpful tool for generating snippets when
 creating pipelines (although if you go to 'Global Variables
 Reference' from there, you'll see them (assuming Jenkins has loaded
 your library at least once as part of a pipeline).
They do offer advantages over plugin steps though: they're easier to
 make changes to, and as this post will highlight, you can use
 different versions easily.

More info: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries[]

Putting shared logic for pipelines into a shared library allows us to
 keep our pipeline Jenkinsfile contents clean and easy to read, and
 also we only have to update in one place when we want to change that
 logic for all jobs.
One problem is that the phrase _making changes that affect many
 pipelines_ can also be written as _making changes that break many
 pipelines_.
Why can't we use the same development flow to make changes to our
 Pipeline shared library as we use in all of our other projects?  It
 turns out we can!

== The library definition in the global Jenkins configuration

In the Jenkinsfile for the shared library, we'll want to be able to
 use the 'library' step, rather than the '@Library' annotation, and
 we'll want to be able to specify a Git branch or GitHub pull request.
This will require making some changes to the definition in the global
 configuration. Specifically, we'll want the following:

- Uncheck 'Load Implicitly' (beware that this could affect existing jobs)
- Check 'Allow default version to be overridden'
- In the GitHub configuration, add behaviours like in the image below
  ('Discover Branches', 'Discover pull requests from origin',
  'Discover pull requests from forks'):

The first two choices here ('Load Implicitly' and 'Allow default
 version to be overridden') will allow us to use the library step to
 choose a different version of this library than the default.
In this case, we'll have a CI job for the shared library defined in a
 Jenkinsfile in the repo, which will get triggered on a GitHub pull
 request.
The version of the shared library we want to use in the CI job, is the
 version from that same pull request -- this is what the additional
 behaviours in the GitHub section allow us to specify!

== The Jenkinsfile in the library repository

....
node {
    // Load your library!
    def pipelineLibrary = library("my-pipeline-library@${env.BRANCH_NAME}")

    // We store a reference to it in a variable, so that we can
    // instantiate classes from it like this!
    def utils = pipelineLibrary.org.feedhenry.Utils.new()

    stage('Test a global variable) {

        // A global variable doesn't need to use the library variable,
        // since it's global
        String myResult = sayHello('Joe')
        assert myResult == 'Hello Joe!'
    }
}
....

To explain the above a little:

- Since we're using the 'GitHub Branch Source' plugin to create jobs
  for the branches and pull requests for the projects in our
  organization, this Pipeline could be run from a pull request, or
  from a regular branch. Wherever it's from, we want to use the
  library from that same ref, and that's what we determine and store
  in the String 'gitref'.
- Holding a variable reference to it will allow us to instantiate
  classes from the library, such as the Utils class in the above
  example.
- We can use 'global variables' such as 'sayHello' above.
- Using the Groovy
  http://groovy-lang.org/semantics.html#_power_assertion['assert'
  keyword], we can test classes and global variables directly in the
  Pipeline!
- If your shared library is in a public repository, you might want to
  protect this job from people who just want to use it to get your
  Jenkins instance to do their bidding. See
  link:blog/jenkins-pipeline-trust.html[my previous post about adding
  a 'trust' stage to your Jenkinsfile].

== Pre-merge testing against other jobs

By default, the library version that you've specified in the global
 configuration will be what's loaded in your pipeline.
If that's a branch (convenient), then once you merge your changes back
 to the branch, those changes will apply to future pipeline executions.
Wouldn't it be great to be able to try it out in affected pipeline
 jobs one by one, rather than breaking them all at once?

If it's possible to test those other pipelines without having to worry
 about their side effects, or some rigid process around them, then you
 can -- no need to merge your change first and risk breaking many
 pipelines!

Rembember the GitHub repository configuration we defined for the
 library in the shared configuration?
You can make use of that in the other Pipeline jobs by specifying the
 pull request (or other branch) when loading your library there too.
When we're manually testing them out like this, we know the ref we
 want to use, so we can use that directly in the @Library annotation,
 if that's how the Pipeline's load it.

To test out a custom version of the shared library in another Pipeline
 that similarly gets loaded from a Git repository using the "GitHub
 Branch Source" plugin or something similar, you could create a dummy
 pull request to that repository, which just changes the version of
 the library to that of your library pull request.
Otherwise, you could use the 'Replay' functionality in the Pipeline
 job in Jenkins to modify the Pipeline for your once-off execution.
