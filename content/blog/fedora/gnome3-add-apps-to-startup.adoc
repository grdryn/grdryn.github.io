Since I started using GNOME 3 a while back, one feature that I’ve wanted to see
is an option to have certain programs start up when I login. Unfortunately I
haven’t had time to look into this until now, and  a quick look in the release
notes pointed me in the right direction. There are two ways of doing this;
neither of which I find very obvious, and both do essentially the same thing.
The easiest way is by using gnome-session-properties. Unfortunately, this is
something that the shell in GNOME 3 doesn’t seem to know much about. Entering it
in the search bar in the shell doesn’t provide anything useful, apart from a
wikipedia or google search possibility. To open the dialog, we must either open
a terminal and enter gnome-session-properties, or hit the trusty Alt+F2 and
enter it there. At this point, I would like to point out that the Alt+F2 command
launcher now has tab auto-completion (I’m not sure if that was a feature before
or not, but I’ve only noticed it now)!

As you can see, this presents us with the familiar Startup Applications
Preferences dialog, where we can add/remove applications to our hearts content!
As you can see from the screenshot, the first application I added was RSIBreak.
This is a handy little utility to help prevent Repetitive Strain Injury.

The alternative way to add something to startup on login is to manually create
the.desktop files in ~/.config/autostart. Some examples can be found in
/usr/share/applications.
