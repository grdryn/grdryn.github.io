http://pump.io/[Pump.io] is a "social server with an ActivityStreams API". It's
from the same people that originally created StatusNet, which has now become
http://gnu.io/[GNU social]. Pump.io servers are nodes in a federated social
network: when you have an account on one, you can interact with others on that
server, but also others with accounts on other pump.io servers. It's free
software, so you can host your own instance and connect to others, wherever
their servers may be.

See the https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/wiki/User-Guide[Pump.io User Guide] for
more information and links.

The default method of using Pump.io is through a web interface that comes as
part of the core software. This is good, but there are a few rough edges here
and there. There are a few android applications, such as
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.e43.impeller[Impeller],
https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=pump&fdid=org.macno.puma[Puma],
and https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.andstatus.app[AndStatus].

More importantly for this post, there are a couple of nice desktop applications,
two of which are packaged in COPRs for Fedora, made by
http://sylke.altervista.org/repo/[HowCanUHaveMyUsername]!

== Dianara
Dianara is a Qt-based application and is quite customizable. To add
https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/howcanuhavemyusername/Dianara/[the COPR],
run:

 sudo dnf copr enable howcanuhavemyusername/Dianara

then to install:

 sudo dnf install dianara

== Pumpa
Pumpa is also Qt-based, but has a more minimal default interface than Dianara.
More information on Pumpa is available https://pumpa.branchable.com/[here]. To
add https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/howcanuhavemyusername/Pumpa/[the COPR],
run:

 sudo dnf copr enable howcanuhavemyusername/Pumpa

then to install:

 sudo dnf install pumpa
