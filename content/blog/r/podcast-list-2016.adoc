:toc-title: TL;DR Navigation

I've started listening to podcasts again, as I've had a commute of
  around 40 minutes in the last few months.
Unsurprisingly, the majority of the podcasts that I listen to
  frequently are focused on free software or software development in
  general.
So here's a list of some of the shows that I listen to regularly now.
For my full podcast list (including ones not listed here that I
  haven't really gotten around to listening to yet), feel free to
  download link:../../podcasts-2016.opml[my OPML file here].
I'd love to hear about what's missing from the list, so feel free to
  suggest a new one to me!

== Software development

=== The Changelog

https://changelog.com/[Homepage] |
http://feeds.5by5.tv/changelog[RSS] |
https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/the-changelog/id341623264[iTunes]

The Changelog is a show about usually open source software projects
  and communities that are interesting to developers / engineers.
The format is usually an interview with a community or project leader,
  and they get some great guests.
The high quality interviews make it a popular show, which in turn
  attracts these high profile guests, so the quality and popularity
  keep rising!
I listen to this show a lot, but I sometimes skip episodes that are on
  some specific topic that I'm not currently interested in.
Instead, I often end up scrolling back to older episodes from before I
  started following (there are over 200 now!).

=== Ruby Rogues

https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues[Homepage] |
http://feeds.feedwrench.com/RubyRogues.rss[RSS] |
https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ruby-rogues/id705335155[iTunes]

Despite the name, and the description on their site, my experience
  with this podcast is that it's not all that ruby-specific -- which
  is great, because I really like it, but I'm not a Ruby developer!
It's more of a panel discussion show with a cast of hosts and an
  expert guest on a particular topic; where many of the topics are
  cross-cutting aspects of software engineering, rather than a
  specific project or ecosystem, making it applicable to all types of
  engineers involved in software production.
This is definitely a favourite of mine at the moment, and when I run
  out of things to listen to, I go back and find older episodes in the
  archive that I haven't heard yet.

=== Software Engineering Radio

http://www.se-radio.net/[Homepage] |
http://feeds.feedburner.com/se-radio[RSS] |
https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/software-engineering-radio/id120906714[iTunes]

SE-Radio is similar in ways to The Changelog.
I haven't been listening to it for very long, but in that time it has
  risen high in my list of favourites.
It seems to be usually a 1:1 interview with a guest from a given
  project or community or company or research field or somewhere.
To give you an idea, some of the topics recent topics have been Ruby
on Rails, Alluxio, OpenStack, recruiting, and Clojure.

=== NodeUp

http://nodeup.com/[Homepage] |
http://feeds.feedburner.com/NodeUp[RSS] |
https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/nodeup/id447667314[iTunes]

At my current job  at Red Hat, we use NodeJS heavily.
The NodeUp podcast is a great show for anyone interested in hearing
  about what's going on in the NodeJS community!
It tends to be a conversation between a host or two (rotated) and two
or three guests, around some aspect of the NodeJS ecosystem that the
guests are involved with.

=== FLOSS Weekly

https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly[Homepage] |
http://feeds.twit.tv/floss.xml[RSS] |
https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/floss-weekly-mp3/id140847216[iTunes]

This was one of the first to get added to my current list, as I used
  to listen to it before.
It's a weekly show with the format being two hosts (usually Randal
  Schwartz and another rotating host) interviewing the community
  lead(s) of a given free software project/product.
It's also streamed live (and recorded I believe) as a video cast, but
  I have to admit to never having viewed it.
As a show that has been going for over 10 years now (!), they've got a
  back-catalog of almost 400 shows now, so there are many gems to be
  found in the archive.

=== The InfoQ Podcast

https://www.infoq.com/the-infoq-podcast[Homepage] |
http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:215740450/sounds.rss[RSS]

This is a relatively new podcast, with only 7 episodes at the time of
  writing.
It comes from the people behind the InfoQ site and QCon conferences.
If you are familiar with the InfoQ site, you might have an idea of the
  breadth of topics that it covers -- not all are interesting to
  everyone, but at least some will be relevant to some engineers.
The podcast isn't as busy as the website, but I imagine that the
  episode topics will vary to the same degree.
Definitely worth following so that you don't miss the episodes that
  interest you, even if not all do.

=== Thoughtworks Beacon Podcast

https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights[Homepage]
http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:94605026/sounds.rss[RSS]

You may have heard of Thoughtworks, the software consulting company
  who publish the Thoughtworks Technology Radar every few months, with
  their thoughts on trends in the industry.
The podcast is an interesting one, as it doesn't try to stick to a
  defined format or length.
Many of the episodes are shorter thoughts on a particular topic, and
  others are longer interviews or discussions.
Some episodes sounds like they may be scripted, which (if so) is
  interestingly different, and makes these episodes more like recorded
  blog posts.
I don't find that to be an issue at all though: it doesn't detract
  from the quality; and after all, there aren't any hard format rules
  that podcasts have to stick by, are there? :)

== Free software / Free culture

=== Linux Voice

https://www.linuxvoice.com/[Homepage] |
http://www.linuxvoice.com/podcast_mp3.rss[RSS (mp3)] |
http://www.linuxvoice.com/podcast_ogg.rss[RSS (Ogg)]

Yes, it's those people that make the magazine!
I used to listen to the TuxRadar podcast, which is the predecessor to
  this (it's just rebranded after the move to the new magazine), so this
  was an early addition to the new list.
It's structured into different sections, which is a nice break from
  the common interview format of many of the podcasts that I listen
  to:

* _News_ - what has happened in the world of GNU/Linux and free software
  since the previous episode
* _Finds of the fortnight_ - each of the hosts talks about something
  interesting that they've learned about recently.
* _Vocalise your neurons_ - Listeners can send a rant or rave about
  something and email it to Mike to read, and the hosts discuss.
* _Voice of the masses_ - A question is asked for the community to
  give their opinions on through the comments on the website.
  A sampling of the opinions is provided on the show and discussed.

=== Bad Voltage

http://www.badvoltage.org/[Homepage] |
http://www.badvoltage.org/feed/mp3/[RSS (mp3)] |
http://www.badvoltage.org/feed/ogg/[RSS (Ogg)] |
http://www.itunes.com/podcast?id=732017066[iTunes]

Similar to Linux Voice, in that it's a constant panel of hosts talking
  about what's new in this crazy world since the last episode.
The hosts are pretty high profile individually, so there's always
  lively debate.
Sometimes there are guest cameos for particular segments, and often a
  gadget review.

=== Hacker Public Radio

http://hackerpublicradio.org/[Homepage] |
http://hackerpublicradio.org/syndication.php[Feeds (many options!)]

HPR is a feed that I follow and listen selectively rather than trying
  to consume every episode, as there's a lot (notice how they've got
  split feeds for 'latest' and 'all', with warnings attached to the
  'all' feeds due to the size)!
Episodes are submitted by community members, and can be any length.
The only guideline is that topics should be of interest to hackers.

=== Free as in Freedom

http://faif.us/[Homepage] |
http://faif.us/feeds/cast-mp3/[RSS (mp3)] |
http://faif.us/feeds/cast-ogg/[RSS (Ogg)]

I follow this show, but it currently appears dormant.
It's usually a discussion amont the esteemed hosts, Karen Sandler and
  Bradley Kuhn, about free software licensing and other concerns; with
  the occasional guest.

== General Interest

=== Freakonomics Radio

http://freakonomics.com/[Homepage] |
http://feeds.feedburner.com/freakonomicsradio[RSS] |
https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/freakonomics-radio/id354668519[iTunes]

This is a very professionally prepared podcast compared to most that I
  listen to -- it's clear that a lot of work from more people than
  just the host goes into each episode.
I'm sure the fact that it airs on public radio in the US helps to fund
  that.
The topics here are taken from a very broad spectrum, such as
  Leicester City football club winning the English Premier League, or
  religion, or suicide, or sleep, or anything else.

=== Star Talk

http://startalkradio.net/[Homepage] |
http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:38128127/sounds.rss[RSS] |
http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/startalk/id325404506[iTunes]

This is another one that's also a radio show (and now a TV show?).
I'm not going to bother describing this one, since it's probably one
o f the most popular podcasts around.

=== Ted Talks (audio)

http://blog.ted.com/audio_podcasts/[Homepage] |
http://feeds.feedburner.com/tedtalks_audio[RSS] |
https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tedtalks-audio/id160904630[iTunes]

Yes, there's a curated list of Ted talks that's edited for audio-only
  consumption, and this is it!
The episodes are usually shorter than a lot of other podcasts, as it's
  just one person giving a live talk.
The shorter length is nice in my experience; as although topics aren't
  explored in a huge amount of depth, they're more digestable than a
  longer show (maybe it's just that they fit more easily into my
  commute).
