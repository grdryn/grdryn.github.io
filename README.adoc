== Connecting to instance console over SSH

Sometimes files don't get deleted as expected when updating components such as Matomo.
Do the following to get access to be able to clean up:

. Enable temporary console for the site in Gandi
. Ensure the following is added to `+~/.ssh/config+`:

----
Host blog_console
    User <user from console>
    HostName <hostname from console>
    HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
    PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa
----

. Connect with `+ssh blog_console+`
