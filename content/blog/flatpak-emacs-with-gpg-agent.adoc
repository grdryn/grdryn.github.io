TL;DR: Enable socket-activated gpg-agent && add an override to the
Emacs flatpak for `--filesystem=xdg-run/gnupg:ro`.

When I first installed Fedora Silverblue a couple of releases ago, one
of the first flatpaks I installed was (obviously) Emacs. Unfortunately
I switched back to the layered package pretty quickly, because any
time I tried to do anything that involved GPG (including signing Git
commits, tags, etc), I ran into trouble. I didn't have the time to
dive into the depths of flatpak at the time, but because I'm on
lockdown for a long weekend, I do now!

The first thing that I learned when searching around the web (hoping
that someone had posted something that I could just paste into a
terminal), was that making use of gpg-agent from within a flatpak is
not a solved problem. There are a couple of open issues against some
specific flatpaks where people, and there are more general issues like
https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/178[this proposal
to add a portal], and
https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/2301[this issue to add a
socket option].

I initially went down the path of trying to copy what some other
flatpaks do: I built a custom Emacs flatpak with `pinentry` installed,
& changed the default command to be a script that would start a local
gpg-agent inside the flatpak sandbox instance, then run emacs, and
kill that local gpg-agent before exiting. I even opened
https://github.com/flathub/org.gnu.emacs/pull/25[a pull-request to
propose this be added to the main emacs flatpak]!

Thankfully, after banging my head on several flatpak and gpg-shaped
walls, I found what I think is a simpler way! Firstly, the magic
override to give the flatpak sandbox enough permission seems to be the
following (thanks to
https://github.com/flathub/org.mozilla.Thunderbird[the Thunderbird
flatpak README] for the tip):

[source,bash]
----
flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-run/gnupg:ro org.gnu.emacs
----

Next, while testing with that I found that if there isn't a running
gpg-agent, gpg inside the flatpak sandbox will have a bad time, and
give an error like the following:

----
[gryan@localhost ~]$ flatpak run --user --command=sh org.gnu.emacs
[ðŸ“¦ org.gnu.emacs ~]$ gpg --decrypt .authinfo.gpg
gpg: can't connect to the agent: IPC connect call failed
gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID 123D53E57C1D8F89, created 2019-04-05
      "Gerard Ryan <redacted@example.com>"
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
----

Enabling and starting socket-activated gpg-agent for the user via
systemd magically made it happy again. The systemd units for this
aren't installed into a usable location by default, but instead come
shipped as examples in the gnupg2 RPM; so we need to make them
available to systemd & enable & start the socket:

[source,bash]
----
sudo ln -s /usr/share/doc/gnupg2/examples/systemd-user/gpg-agent.s* /etc/systemd/user/
systemctl --user enable gpg-agent.socket
systemctl --user start gpg-agent.socket
----

That's it! Everything should work as expected now.

== Bonus Emacs content!

With the above, if gpg-agent needs your passphrase from Emacs, you'll
get the usual GNOME 3 system prompt. If you'd prefer to be prompted in
a more Emacs-native way, you can do the following:

* Add `allow-emacs-pinentry` to `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`
* Install the `pinentry` package in Emacs
* Add `(pinentry-start)` to your Emacs configuration
